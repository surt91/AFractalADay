*   more fractal types
    *   L systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system>
        *   randomized L systems
    *   fractal flame <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame>
        *   use <http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper210.pdf>
            to create more interesting IFS and flames
    *   strange attractors
    *   diffusion limited aggregation
    *   self-avoiding walk
    *   dragon curve
    *   menger sponge

*   random default vibrancy value
*   parse function from cla
*   neural net classifier: interesting <-> not interesting
*   vibrancy and gamma need to be saved in the json export

*   Generic L-systems:
    -   pass rules per cli
    -   random generation of rules
    -   pass specific systems as rule-strings instead of the current overheady way

*   wait for rand to enable arbitrary hashable values as seed, then refactor
